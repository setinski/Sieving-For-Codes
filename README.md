# Sieving For Codes

In this project, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the sieving-style algorithm for solving decoding problems and experimental validation of the heuristics required for instantiating the sieving algorithm as a sub-routine of an ISD algorithm. The code for the first is given in  SievingISD_asymptotic_optimization.ipynb Python notebook, while the code for the experimental validation is given in the Heuristic_validation directory. The numerical results accompany the theoretical results presented in the corresponding paper.

## Project's dependencies

Both the asymptotic analysis and the heuristic validation experiments require Python 3. In addition to that, the heuristics validation experiments require a CPU that supports Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX).

The asymptotic optimization requires the python packages progressbar, numpy and scipy you can install those using the terminal command

<pre translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded="">
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

or just run the first cell of the jupyter notebook.

## Asymptotic plots

All asymptotic plots can be reproduced by running SievingISD_asymptotic_optimization.ipynb jupyter notebook. To open this
file you require the web application jupyter, which you can install via 

<pre translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded="">
pip3 install jupyterlab
</pre>

To then start jupyter just execute

<pre translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded="">
jupyter lab
</pre>

This opens the jupyter web application in your standard browser. Now you can navigate to the corresponding directory and 
open the file ```SievingISD_asymptotic_optimization.ipynb```. Then simply press the two right-oriented arrows at the top
which will execute all cells of the notebook. 

(The data for the paper was generated by executing the notebook using a python 3.11.4 jupyter kernel)


## Build the sieveisd library (for Linux distributions)

To build the sieveisd library for n
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded="">make sieveisdlib LENGTH=$n
</pre>
where n is the code length. If no parameters are provided, n = 256.

## Run the experiments

To obtain the results and visualization of the comparison between the theoretical prediction and the experimental data, run
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded="">
python comparison.py $n $w $k $i
</pre>
where n is the code length, w is the weight of the error, and k is the code dimension. If no parameters are provided, n = 256, w = 6, and k = 0.

## Results of the experiments

The results of the experiments and the comparison are recorded in the ./Data/n$n directory.
